# RealEstateRentals
This repository contains a smart contract for managing real estate rentals on the Stacks blockchain. The contract allows a landlord to set rent amounts, register tenants, and handle rent payments and penalties for late payments. The project includes unit tests to ensure the contract functions correctly.
